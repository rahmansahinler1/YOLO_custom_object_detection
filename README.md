# YOLO_custom_object_detection
From scratch custom object detection training system with YOLO-v3. You can adapt this to the next YOLO versions.
I've done this project for Ford OTOSAN at May-August 2022 for custom object detection at factory for safety.

# Steps
1. Create custom dataset with images
2. Create a image dataset with labelImg
3. Select hyperparameters and label names wihin your code
4. Upload your files into your google drive
5. Enter google colab, training is explained step by step
6. Train your model (at least 4 hours)
7. You can save your model and re-train it
8. After training take weights file and deploy your model
9. You can set the confidence level and start detection custom objects.
10. ! Dataset is very critical be sure that your dataset at least has 1000 images for 1 object.
11. ! If you can't gather that much of image data you can increase the number of images in your dataset with giving it new features with roboflow.

14. It's completely open source. You can use it how ever you want.
